## 📚 Project Feature

This repository is focused on two main technological pillars:

*   **Robotics Middleware (ROS2):** Node architecture, robotic simulation, and motion planning utilizing core ROS2 tools including RViz, and MoveIt2. This is tailored specifically for controlling the Ufactory 850 cobot on ROS2 Jazzy.
*   **Computer Vision (Python):** Real-time object detection and video streaming pipelines utilizing YOLOv11 and OpenCV.
